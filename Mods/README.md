> doomc.pk3 ("Doom Custom")
- This file contains experimentation and an unfinished mod that overhauls all of Doom's weapons.
- The only rework that was completed is for the shotgun. Multiple shells can be loaded into the weapon using alt-fire, with the number of pellets fired scaling with the number of shells loaded. There are changes to sound and effects involved as well.
