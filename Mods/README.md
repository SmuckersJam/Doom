> doomc.pk3 ("Doom Custom")
- This file contains experimentation and an unfinished mod that overhauls all of Doom's weapons.
- The only rework that was completed is for the shotgun. Multiple shells can be loaded into the weapon using alt-fire, with the number of pellets fired scaling with the number of shells loaded. There are changes to sound and effects involved as well.
  - There is also an incomplete dual-wield (and tri-wield, don't ask) pistol. The "ready" sprite for the first state is done, but I haven't done anything else because I don't have the time to create a sprite for every frame of animation on the pistol.
- The objective of the weapon rework was to demonstrate various Doom engine skills with each weapon. The shotgun was meant to demonstrate the basics and scripting, the pistol was meant to demonstrate state handling and sprite-work.
